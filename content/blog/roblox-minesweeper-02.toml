description = """
In this update, I added an animation for board generation and made the mine counters colorful. Flag collisions are now removed, and I added a spawn animation for the flag. Flags are limited, so you canâ€™t use them endlessly. Sound effects are now included for tile reveals, flag removals, and explosions. Mines have been changed from a red block to textures, and the minefield logic is now in a local script.

future_plans = """
I plan to add a UI in the future, I have never done UI in roblox before.
