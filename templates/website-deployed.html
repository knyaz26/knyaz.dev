            <h3>description</h3>
            <p>It took me 3 days to make this site, which is a lot considering how basic it is. But that’s by design—I prefer keeping things simple. The site has five pages: Projects, Blog, Knyaz, Resources, and Contact. It’s just a basic blog site.</p>
            <h3>technologies used</h3>
            <p>I used Golang for routing and named templates. I didn’t do much else with Go, but it was the best option for keeping things organized. Named templates were especially useful definitely a must have. I deployed the site on Render, which is free and easy to use. It auto-updates with each commit, which is great since im very lazy. The domain is from Namecheap, costing me $9.</p>
            <h3>future plans</h3>
            <p>The site isn’t responsive yet, and there are parts I don’t completely understand. It works, but there’s a lot of room for improvement. I plan to update the site and deal with issues over time.
            <h3>resources</h3>
            <p>source code available on my github <a href="https://www.github.com/knyaz26/knyaz.dev">here</a>.</p>
            <h3>logs</h3>
            <p>no logs available.</p>
